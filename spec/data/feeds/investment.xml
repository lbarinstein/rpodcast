			<title>meth Labs And Investment Property</title>
			<itunes:author>Craig Williams</itunes:author>
			<itunes:subtitle />
			<itunes:summary>In this podcast I talk about a article I read about meth labs and investment property.  The article talks about a retired couple who faced clean-up costs totaling 84,000 for a rental property used in the production of meth. The really bad twist on this story is that the house only appraised for $72,000. They also tell about another homeowner who had to pay $60,000 to decontaminate a property used to make meth, That was the largest total since the law took effect in 2005. Caoimhin Connel said about the clean-up “they can run from a couple of hundred dollars to a couple of hundred thousand dollars”
 As always consult a lawyer or a real estate professional before making any major real estate investing decisions.</itunes:summary>

			<title>When Am I Going To Feel Comfortable Investing In Real Estate</title>
			<itunes:author>Craig Williams</itunes:author>
			<itunes:subtitle />
			<itunes:summary>In this podcast I talk about the question of when am I going to feel comfortable Investing in real estate.     
I have had many questions from listeners and readers about needing even more information before they are able to invest in a investment property. The first question that you have to ask yourself is what are you getting this information for. Read and get as much information as you can for the first couple of months. Use books, podcasts, and blogs to gain as much knowledge as you can. You should always continue to educate yourself and keep up on new developments in the future. But if your researching to get rid of all doubt in your investing you may never get to that point.
